# Installation & Usage
1. Install actual python version [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/p/python-38/9mssztt1n39l).

3. Edit TovoViewerCount.py file and replace 
`streamerURL = "V4n1X"` with your channel name. Don't remove the quotes "" .

5. New file `TrovoViewerCount.txt` is created and auto updated every 2 seconds in the same location as the script is placed!
6. Open as every other text file in OBS or your streaming software.

## Bugs
- Script throws some exceptions, but I catched them all (I hope)
